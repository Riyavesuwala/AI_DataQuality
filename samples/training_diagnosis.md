1. Unsafe Responses

->Poorly filtered training data.
->Missing examples.
->Lack of safety instructions in sample data.

2. Hallucinated Answers

->Over optimization without accuracy constrainsts.

3. Instruction Drift

->Inconsistent role usage in training data.
->Mixed prompts without clear instructions.

4. Overfitting

->low-divers dataset.
->Memorization of unsafe responses.

5. Bias

->Unfiltered dataset containing biased text.

6. Model not properly trained

->Incomplete training data.
->Inconsistent dataset.
->Lack of safety-focused examples.
