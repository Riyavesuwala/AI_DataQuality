# Topic – Dynamic Agent System & Safe Deployment

## Overview
This repository contains AI DataQuality points focused on:
- Data quality repair
- Training failure diagnosis
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Safe deployment using a dynamic, multi-agent AI system

This emphasizes **reasoning, safety, and system design** rather than heavy implementation.

---

## Objectives Covered
- Repair low-quality training data into safe, professional support-style conversations
- Diagnose training issues such as overfitting, instability, and instruction drift
- Recommend improved training hyperparameters with justification
- Design a dynamic agent-based system with safety guardrails and intent routing
